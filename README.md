# Maize_Disease_Classification

This repository contains my solution for the Maize Leaf Disease Classification Challenge. The goal is to train a model to identify different maize (corn) leaf diseases just by looking at pictures. The four types we're dealing with are:

- **Blight**
- **Common Rust**
- **Gray Leaf Spot**
- **Healthy**

The model steadily improved over 15 epochs:

- **Best Validation Accuracy:** **91.40%**

The tested data or final result is saved in submission.csv file.
